About Level 2
Overview

You are now minutes away from building your first website, from A to Z. That means that not only will you build a website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript but you will also install and run your web server (Apache) on your own Linux machine (Ubuntu). Note that most web servers out there are also running Linux as an operating system and Apache as a web server software; so you'll be already using what industry professionals are using!

Here is an overview of what you will do and learn during Level 2:

    access a distant server using ssh
    learn the very basics of the Linux command line
    install a software on Linux
    use the Emacs text editor
    install a web server on Linux
    read a configuration file
    use HTML, CSS and javascript to build a website
    and most importantly: search for information and help each other

The Linux command line

Linux is an operating system (like Windows or Mac OS), which you will use through a terminal window, using command lines. The command line interface (CLI) is not a graphical interface, it’s only text. It looks like this:

What does this all mean? How can you create a file, or go to a given folder without any icons, without using the mouse, and only by typing text on a screen? How do you even edit or move a file to a different folder? That is what you will learn during the first challenges of Level 2, in order to then be able to install your Apache web server and edit and manipulate your first HTML files to build your website.
The Level 2

Level 2 is composed of a mandatory part, and an optional part. The mandatory part is… mandatory. If you do not finish it, you won't be invited to move forward to Level 3 (interviews). If you do a part or all of the optional part, you will earn extra points. We also encourage you to go beyond what we ask for, and spend some extra time on aspects of the project you enjoy most. In fact, what you build extra will be taken into account as much as what you're required to do, when your final application will be evaluated.

Sometimes, we give you tips and links to help you solve a challenge. Those tips and links will be listed at the end of the page of the challenge. We advise you to read them before starting to solve it.

Most of the time, we will not give you all the required information to solve the challenges of Level 2. You are expected to go by yourself find information online and ask other candidates about what you don't know or understand.

Many Level 2 challenges you'll go through are designed to reuse things you've learned from previous Level 2 challenges; but you will usually only be told new information once. We advise you to carefully note everything that you learn in order to progress smoothly through the level.

During this level, your best friends are going to be Google, StackOverflow and your peers (on the Forum). Whenever you feel lost, ask them for help.

Try to solve the challenges by following those steps:

    Read the challenge entirely - then try to solve the challenge
    Read the links we have provided you in the tips and links section - then try to solve the challenge
    Try Google and StackOverflow to find answers, find required information, understand an error, etc… - then try to solve the challenge
    Ask your peers on the Forum - then try to solve the challenge
    Go back to step 0 until you solve the challenge

Failure is not an option

During this level, you will be put out of your comfort zone. If you have never used Linux or the command line before, it will be like learning how to use a computer for the first time. If you feel completely lost at the beginning, it's totally normal.

You will fail many more times than during Level 1. It is part of the process. The good news is: the more you will fail, the more you will learn. And the more you will progress through Level 2, the easier it will get as you will learn how to learn, faster and faster.

That being said, Level 2 is designed for complete beginners, so with enough work and dedication, you should finish at least the mandatory part within two weeks.
Two weeks

Once you hit the "Start Level 2!" button, you will have two weeks to complete it. You can start whenever you want, but we strongly advise you to start as soon as possible: we will process applications in the order they arrive.

When you are done with Level 2, you are welcome to continue to help other candidates on the Forum.
Your server

For completing Level 2, we give you access to a dedicated Linux server, with root privilege. This means that you have full administrative privilege, and the freedom to do whatever you want on the server. You can install whatever you want, delete whatever you want, you can personalize the server, you can stop it... you can also completely destroy it. Don't worry, if you follow our instructions you won't destroy anything.

Here again, you are allowed to do extra stuff on the server. Just try not to destroy it :)

Remember that you are responsible for your server. Absolutely never give your password to anyone, even to the Holberton School team. We also ask that you please do not change the root password on your server.
The Forum

The big difference between Level 2 and an Holberton School project, is that you will not be all together in the same room. So we have setup a forum (a chat room) to help and be helped. Here are some rules about the Forum:

    Make sure you read the tips and links we gave you and try Google and StackOverflow before asking any question on the Forum
    When you ask a question, tell your peers what you tried, and give them all information possible, including all error messages you get
    Help your peers by giving them directions. Never give your peers the answers otherwise they will never learn anything
    Be polite ♥

We encourage you to interact with each other as much as you can, as we look at applicants' interactions on the Forum closely when evaluating applications.

As always, you are free to use any tool you like to interact, help and encourage each other. You can organize working sessions on Skype; If you live near other candidates, you can meet and work together; You can use Twitter; Etc…
Forum Credentials

The email you received with the acceptance to level 2 also includes a link to join the Forum. If you haven't received this email, please check your spam folder. If you still can’t find it, please use this form to contact us.
Level 3

We will process applications in the order they arrive, first-come first-served and we have only 32 spots available for the first class. Make sure to finish Level 2 as soon as possible if you want a better chance to be admitted. Higher priority will be given to candidates who:

    Helped their peers
    Finished Level 2 with the optional part, and built interesting things beyond what was asked
    Had great essays and videos from the Level 1

Please do Level 2 by yourself. Make sure you understand everything you do. During level 3, we will ask you to do part of Level 2 again in front of us.
